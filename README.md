# Tempest-THM-Walkthrough
This is a "purple-team" room made by TryHackMe. I highly recommend it, I enjoyed it, I really didn't felt any mark of distinction between this and any other blue team task I've done so far, so to be categorised "purple team" went unnoticed to me. I enjoyed the tasks at hands, and investigative nature of this.



## Brim and Wireshark ü¶à

For this room, you'll use Brim and Wireshark, if you haven't got familiar with those two tools, I highly suggest you find the official documentation along with the free material you'll see in TryHackMe, so you 'familiarise' yourself a bit better. There are some easy rooms in TryHackMe, where you'll analyse packets, and answer some questions based on the analysed data. Do not forget to take notes! And/or bookmark the room so you can give a read back if you ever get stuck.



## Plus points üíØ

I reckon that doing redteam, as well as certain paths of pentest from TryHackMe, in combination with the SOC analyst level 1 path and other blue team rooms, have helped me to 'guess' or 'know' certain answers straight-away.
It might help you understand what to look for, and/or form your 'investigative' plan a bit better for this room as you go. So, maybe this is the 'purple-team' sprinkle of the room.



### Windows üóî

I'm positive that in the room you'll see the technologies you'd have to be familiar with before going in,  and I'm positive you'll have to be somewhat familiar with windows sysmon, event viewer, and you'll get introduced to other tools in there which you can get it in no time, however, *THM* does an excellent job at offering some level of *'refreshment'* to understand the necessary use of that tool for the room.


### As I said in the `.txt` file

I checked other walkthroughs that did not contain the answer but the process, and my method might have varied from using one tool to using multiple tools to contrast data, and get to the same answer. 
I think this method have helped me understand some of the material way better, as I take it as a 'investigating' along or even for pentesting paths I've seen it as a 'hack-along'.

## Extras - *no need to read, just a personal 'yapping'*

### Rabbit holes üê∞

As someone who tend to fall into rabit holes of documentation here and there, I highly recommend you to take your time and read documentations, walkthroughs and better understand what you can look for, or what you're dealing with.
However, also understand that you can easily fall into rabbit holes and get yourself too deep into a river of data/information that will just consume your time. I'll say, read the necessary data or the information you need at the moment. 
Bookmark the documentation or information you find along the way, and feel free to give it a read later on, and add it to your notes you've taken before.


### Notes üóíÔ∏è

Take notes, and structure it in a way that is easy for you to digest the information, dumb it down, no guilt in that, I do it all the time. We are not machines, even machines dumb stuff down. 
It is not the 1980s anymore, if you want to use emojis to categorise something, and/or distinguish "b" from "d", then do it. ü§å Your eyes can get tired from reading a lot of information, and you can sometimes get lost in between your notes;
so structure it in a friendly way to your future self.
