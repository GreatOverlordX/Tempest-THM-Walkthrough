# Tempest-THM-Walkthrough
This is a "purple-team" room made by TryHackMe. I highly recommend it, I enjoyed it, I really didn't felt any mark of distinction between this and any other blue team task I've done so far, so to be categorised "purple team" went unnoticed to me. I enjoyed the tasks at hands, and investigative nature of this.
